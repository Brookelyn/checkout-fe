## Thank you for reviewing my tech test!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

From the directory you're able to run the following:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

## Optional enhancements

* Adding error messaging to the inputs
* Adding media queries to ensure a good experience on smaller screen sizes
* I could have spent loads more time on making the graph more interesting.
